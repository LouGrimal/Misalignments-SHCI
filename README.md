# Misalignments-SHCI
The goal of this repository is to share examples of misalignments between values/actions of stakeholders using interactive systems and values embedded in those systems. Don't worry, you can use this platform even if you don't know how to program.

## New to this platform?

You can go to the tab called "issue" to find all the misalignments identified. You can click on the issue you are interested in. You can also sort the issues according to the type of misalignment you want to check, the technical system observed or the context in which the misalignment was observed.

Now it is time to create issues...

## Let's structure the misalignments into issues!

### 1) General structure

Here is the structure I advise you to follow to add an misalignment to the issue tab:

* Context of identification
* Technical system observed
* Misalignment observed

If you are observing a misalignement:type1, then you can add: 

* Values embedded in the software
* Values of the stakeholders

If you are observing a misalignement:type2, then you can add: 

* Values embedded in the software
* Actions wanted by the stakeholders

If you are observing a misalignement:type3, then you can add: 

* Direct effects 
* Enabling effects
* Structuring effects

### 2) Labels

We also advise you to label your issue to allow users to find misalignments very quickly!
There are 3 types of labels: 
* The misalignement (type1, 2 or 3): MA:type1, MA:type or MA:type3
* The technical system: system:nameofyoursystem
* The context: context:nameofthecontext

### 3) Collaboration

You can comment a misalignment added by someone. If you have an example of misalignement linked to an other one, here is the process to follow: 
* you can open a new issue repository, describe the misalignement you have identified
* then put a comment to your new issue and mention the misalignement linked to it
