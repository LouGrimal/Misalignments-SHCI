# Misalignments-SHCI
A repository to share examples of misalignments between values/actions of stakeholders using interactive systems and values embedded in those systems.

## New to this platform?

You can go to the tab called "issue" to find all the misalignments identified. You can click on the issue you are interested in. You can also sort the issues according to the type of misalignment you want to check, the technical system observed or the context in which the misalignment was observed.

You can also create an issue!

## Let's structure the misalignments into issues!

Here is the structure I advise you to follow to add an misalignment to the issue tab:

* Context of identification
* Technical system observed
* Misalignment observed

If you are observing a misalignement:type1, then you can add: 

* Values embedded in the software
* Values of the stakeholders

If you are observing a misalignement:type2, then you can add: 

* Values embedded in the software
* Actions wanted by the stakeholders

If you are observing a misalignement:type3, then you can add: 

* Direct effects 
* Enabling effects
* Structuring effects
